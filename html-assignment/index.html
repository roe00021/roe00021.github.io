        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is <em>Mackenzie Roe</em> and I’m a first-term Interactive Media Design (Co-Op) student. I’m enrolled in this program because I am passionate about UX/UI design and have been progressively working to expand my portfolio.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favourite hobbies is photography and videography. I’ve also been playing the guitar for a few years now which is a relaxing pastime. I’m also an extremely active person and play a lot of sports. I row, play hockey, soccer and go to the gym.</p>

        <p>The following is a quote I find captivating:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." <cite>- Steve Jobs</cite>
