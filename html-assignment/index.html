        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is <em>Mackenzie Roe</em> and I’m a first-term Interactive Media Design (Co-Op) student. I’m enrolled
            in this program because I am passionate about UX/UI design and have been progressively working to expand my
            portfolio. I believe I have a lot of transferable skills that I have learned throughout my education and
            work experience. The biggest transferable skill that I possess is that I am bilingual (French and English).
            I feel as though bilingualism will be an asset for applications as it enables me to work for companies that
            require French speakers, such as popular UX/UI companies in Montreal.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favourite hobbies is photography and videography. I’ve also been playing the guitar for a few years
            now which is a relaxing pastime. I’m also an extremely active person and play a lot of sports. I row, play
            hockey, soccer and go to the gym. I also love computers and video games and have been interested in them
            since a kid. I built my first PC a while ago and have always been able to repair my own devices. I'm looking
            forward to learning HTML and some CSS over the course of the semester!</p>
        <p>Here is a list of my hobbies:</p>

    <p>The following is a quote I find captivating:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living
        with the results of other people's thinking." <cite>- Steve Jobs</cite>
