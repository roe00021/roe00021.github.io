        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is <em>Mackenzie</em> and I’m a first-term Interactive Media Design (Co-Op) student. I’m enrolled in this program because I am passionate about UX/UI design and have been progressively working to expand my portfolio. With my program having a large focus on web design and graphic design, the hope is to acquire a job in user experience and/or interface design. In particular, I am looking forward to the Co-Op term as it will provide me with critical experience in the field. </p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favourite hobbies is photography and videography. I personally enjoy videography the most and have actually shot a couple of weddings. I’ve also been playing the guitar for a few years now which is a relaxing pastime. I’m also an extremely active person and play a lot of sports. I row, play hockey, soccer and go to the gym… When it’s open.</p>
